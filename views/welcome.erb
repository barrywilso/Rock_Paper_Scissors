<h1 id="Welcome-text">This page explains how to play rock, paper & scissors</h1

  <p>The players usually count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro Sham Bo!"), each time either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count or holding it behind. They then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use only three counts before throwing their gesture (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), or a version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing". For our game just enter the combination into the browser to see which one wins, eg-  http://localhost:4567/play/rock/scissors gives us Rock!</p>
